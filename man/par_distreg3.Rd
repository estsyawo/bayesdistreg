\title{Parallel compute bayesian distribution regression}
\usage{
par_distreg3(thresh, data0, fn = distreg, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{thresh}{vector of threshold values. ensure the min and the max generate enough zeros and ones.}

\item{data0}{the original data set with a continous dependent variable in the first column}

\item{fn}{bayesian distribution regression function. the default is distreg provided in the package}

\item{...}{any additional input parameters to pass to fn}
}
\value{
mat a G x M matrix of output (G is the length of thresh, M is the number of draws)
}
\description{
\code{par_distreg3} function uses parallel computation to compute bayesian distribution regression for a given
vector of threshold values and a data (with first column being the continuous dependent variable). It
is suitable for all systems (including Windows)
